Module 9 - SQL homework

This challenge demonstrates data modeling, engineering, and analysis using PostgreSQL. In it, I reviewed six csv files, read them into tables using SQL, and created an entity relationship diagram to connect them. This code can be found in the Employees_schema.sql file. The Employees_queries.sql file contains eight different queries used to organize and analyze the data.
